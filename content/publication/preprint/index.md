abstract: |
  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that distinguishes entities from unorganized text into predefined categorization. In recent years, many Bangla NLP subtasks have received considerable attention; however, Named Entity Recognition in Bangla still lags behind. In this research, we explored the existing state of research in Bangla Named Entity Recognition, identifying the limitations of current techniques and datasets. We propose a novel NER solution that leverages a Gazetteer and state-of-the-art NLP tools to significantly enhance NER performance, surpassing conventional methods.
