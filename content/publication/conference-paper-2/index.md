abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing need for systems capable of detecting whether a text was created by a human or generated by an LLM, in order to prevent the unethical use of these technologies. The ALTA Shared Task 2023 introduced a challenge to develop such an automatic detection system. In this paper, we present our participation in this task by proposing a feature-level ensemble of two transformer models, DeBERTaV3 and XLM-RoBERTa, to create a robust detection system. The dataset provided consisted of textual data labeled for binary classification. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieved competitive performance among the participants, offering a feasible solution for detecting synthetic text.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents a feature-level ensemble of DeBERTaV3 and XLM-RoBERTa models for robust synthetic text detection, achieving competitive performance in the ALTA Shared Task 2023.
